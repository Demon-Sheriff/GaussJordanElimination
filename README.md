# Gauss-Jordan Elimination in Python

## Description

This repository contains Python code implementing the Gauss-Jordan elimination method, a technique used to solve systems of linear equations. The Gauss-Jordan elimination method transforms the augmented matrix of a system of linear equations into reduced row-echelon form (RREF) to find the solutions.

## Features

- **Implementation of Gauss-Jordan Elimination:** Efficiently solves systems of linear equations.
- **Step-by-Step Reduction:** Includes detailed comments and step-by-step explanations.

## Contents

- `gaussjordanelimination.py`: The main Python script containing the implementation of the Gauss-Jordan elimination algorithm.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gauss-jordan-elimination.git
cd gauss-jordan-elimination
